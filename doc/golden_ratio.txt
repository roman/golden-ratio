1. Intro                                                   *golden-ratio-intro*


When working with many windows at the same time, each window has a size
that is not convenient for editing.

golden-ratio helps on this issue by resizing automatically the windows you are
working on to the size specified in the "Golden Ratio". The window that has the
main focus will have the perfect size for editing, while the ones that are
not being actively edited will be re-sized to a smaller size that doesn't get
in the way, but at the same time will be readable enough to know it's content.

2. Options                                               *golden-ratio-options*

                                                        *'loaded-golden-ratio'*
Use this option to disable golden-ratio plugin completely: >
  let g:loaded_golden_ratio = 1
<

                                                   *'golden_ratio_autocommand'*
Use this option to disable the autocommand events for golden ratio
(on by default): >
  let g:golden_ratio_autocommand = 0
<

                                                  *'golden_ratio_wrap_ignored'*
Sets whether 'wrap' is enabled (1) or disabled (0) in ignored windows:
>
  let g:golden_ratio_wrap_ignored = 0
<

                                         *'golden_ratio_exclude_nonmodifiable'*
Use this option to keep all windows that have 'nomodifiable' option set
untouched (off by default): >
  let g:golden_ratio_exclude_nonmodifiable = 1
<
This is useful if you keep things like buffer explorer or tag list
open. Note: Depending on the window layout this may not always work.
