# Golden Ratio

When working with many windows at the same time, each window has a size that is not convenient for editing.

golden-ratio helps on this issue by resizing automatically the windows you are working on to the size specified in the
"Golden Ratio". The window that has the main focus will have the perfect size for editing, while the ones that are not
being actively edited will be re-sized to a smaller size that doesn't get in the way, but at the same time will be
readable enough to know it's content.
